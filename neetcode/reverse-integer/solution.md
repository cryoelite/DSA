# reverse-integer 
## Input 
One 32 bit signed integer `x`
## Problem 
Return `x` after reversing each of its digits, that is `1234` becomes `4321` and so on. There's a catch, and that is, after reversing if `x` goes out the 32 bit range, i.e., `x` is exceeding the range $-2^{31}$ to $2^{31}-1$, then we should return a `0` instead.
## Output 
A reversed 32 bit signed integer, the reverse of `x`.
## Constraints 
`x` >= $-2^{31}$ and <= $2^{31}-1$
