# DSA
Data Structures, and algorithms

# Problem Sources
1. Hackerrank
2. https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=neetcode250

# Some tips
1. Current dir ? https://stackoverflow.com/a/32024051/13036358 Useful if launching the ``run.sh`` with an absolute path, co the executable knows which directory it got called from and could create `input.txt` and `output.txt` in the dir.
2. https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types for built-in c++ data types

# Some problem sites

# Leftovers
1. In hackerrank's between 2 sets, we use LCM and GCD. Still have to learn how exactly GCD is calculated and what it is.
